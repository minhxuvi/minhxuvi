## ðŸ˜„ Fun fact

Did you know that mindfulness can actually change the structure of your brain? According to a study published in the journal Psychiatry Research, participants who underwent an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program showed an increase in gray matter density in the hippocampus, an area of the brain associated with learning and memory, and a decrease in gray matter density in the amygdala, an area of the brain associated with anxiety and stress.
